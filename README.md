# WbleMobile

**WbleMobile** is a mobile application developed as a replica of the UTAR WBLE platform. It aims to reproduce the core functionalities of the existing WBLE system while enhancing accessibility and usability on mobile devices. Unlike the traditional WBLE website currently in use at UTAR, WbleMobile offers a modern, intuitive, and user-friendly interface tailored specifically for mobile users.

This project is a comprehensive full-stack mobile application that integrates multiple components to provide a seamless user experience. Built using **React Native** for the frontend, **Laravel** and **Flask** for the backend services, and incorporating real-time communication capabilities, WbleMobile ensures that users can interact with the platform efficiently and in real-time.

The application supports multiple user roles, including **admins**, **lecturers**, and **students**, each with access to distinct features and interfaces. The role-based access control ensures that users only see and interact with content relevant to their responsibilities, improving usability and security.

Structured into several key modules, WbleMobile covers a wide range of functionalities such as authentication and authorization, course management, notification systems, real-time messaging, and assignment submissions. Each module plays a vital role in building a robust ecosystem that caters to the academic and administrative needs of UTARâ€™s mobile platform.

In summary, WbleMobile is not just a replica of the WBLE websiteâ€”it is an enhanced, mobile-first version designed to provide a better overall experience for all users, making academic and administrative interactions more efficient and accessible anytime, anywhere.

```

# File Upload Handler for Large Files

This module handles file uploads of larger sizes in the wble-backend application by configuring PHP settings to accommodate bigger files and longer processing times.

## Configuration Requirements

To enable large file uploads, the following PHP settings must be configured in your `php.ini` file:

```
upload_max_filesize = 20M
post_max_size = 21M
max_execution_time = 300
memory_limit = 256M
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Locate your PHP configuration file:
   - Run `php --ini` to find the loaded configuration file
   - Navigate to the specified php.ini file

2. Modify the following settings:
   - Set `upload_max_filesize` to 20M (maximum size for individual files)
   - Set `post_max_size` to 21M (slightly larger than upload_max_filesize)
   - Set `max_execution_time` to 300 seconds (5 minutes) for larger uploads
   - Set `memory_limit` to 256M to ensure sufficient memory

3. Restart your web server after making changes

# WBLE Flask Socket
1. Navigate to the Flask Socket directory:
   ```bash
   cd flaskSocket
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

3. Find your JWT secret key in the WBLE backend Laravel `.env` file and add it to your Flask Socket `.env`:
   ```ini
   LARAVEL_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
   ```
   
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5001` by default. You can modify this port in `flaskSocket/app.py`

# WBLE Notification Server
1. Navigate to the Flask Notification directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask-notifi
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

3. Configure Firebase & Application Credentials
- **Create a Firebase Project** (if not done already)  
- Download your **Service Account JSON** file from Your Firebase Project   
- Update `.env` with the correct path:  
  ```ini
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your-service-account.json
  FLASK_INTERNAL_SECRET=your_internal_secret_here  # Must match Laravel's .env
  ```
- Configure Firebase details in `flask-notifi/notification.py` (if needed).
- Example: change the firebase project id based on your use case  

4. Sync `FLASK_INTERNAL_SECRET` with Laravel Backend
   Ensure the same secret is in `NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_SECRET` of Laravelâ€™s `.env`:  
   ```ini
   FLASK_INTERNAL_SECRET=your_internal_secret_here
   ```
   
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python notification.py
   ```
   The server will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5002` by default. You can modify this port in `flask-notifi/notification.py`

### **ðŸ“Œ Example Folder Structure**  
```
flask-notifi/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                    # Config file
â”œâ”€â”€ firebase-adminsdk.json  # Firebase credentials
â”œâ”€â”€ notification.py         # Main server script
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

# WBLE Front-end
1. Navigate to the React Native project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WbleMobile
   ```

2. Install React Native dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create and configure the app configuration file:
   ```bash
   cd src/config
   cp config.example.json config.json
   ```

4. Configure server paths in `src/config/config.js` to point to your backend servers

5. Run the React Native application:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   # or
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```
   
# WBLE Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the WBLE (Web-Based Learning Environment) application. It's built with Laravel PHP framework and uses JWT authentication.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wble-backend.git
cd wble-backend
```

2. Install PHP dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your `.env` file with your database credentials and other settings.

5. Generate application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Create database.sqlite in the database folder
```bash
wble-backend
|-database
|  |-database.sqlite
```

7. Run migrations (this will create fresh tables and seeds your database):
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

8. Generate JWT secret:
```bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```

9. Link the storage for file downloads:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

10. Sync `NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_SECRET` with `FLASK_INTERNAL_SECRET` of Notification Server (if not done)
   Ensure the same secret is in Notification Serverâ€™s `.env`:  
   ```ini
   NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_SECRET=your-internal-secret-here
   ```

11. Ensure `NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL` with points to the notification server
   ```ini
   NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5002
   ```

12. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
